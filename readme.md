# Bootstrap basic portfolio rw-write
Had I been aware of the option sooner I probalby would have done a total redesign rather than just rework the basic design into a bootstrap grid framework.

I opted to maintain a full width portfolio page given the nture of the conent as compared to the left aligned secions of the about and contact pages. I suspect the idea behind aligning the content left was to demonstrate bootstrap's grid use primarily. On the whole I would probably re-style the non boostrap version or do a complete re-write in the future for a live portfolio page.
