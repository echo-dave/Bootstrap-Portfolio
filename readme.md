# Bootstrap basic portfolio rw-write
Had I been aware of the option soon I probalby would have done a total redesign rather that just rework the basic design into a bootstrap grid framework.

I opted to maintain a full width portfolio page given the nture of the conent. I suspect the idea behind pushing the about and contact page to the right was to demonstrate bootstrap's grid use. On the whole I would probably re-style or do a complete re-write in the future for a live portfolio page.
